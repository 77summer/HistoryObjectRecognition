# The Modern History of Object Recognition
An Adobe Illustrator project that tells the modern history of object recognition in the infographics format. Every illustrations are redrawn to make them more consistent and understandable. Note that although I've built the 3D model for AlexNet and many materials are included in this project, I did not use it in the final infographics.

Main Files:
  - HistoryOfObjectRecognition.ai:                The main file, containing the whole project
  - HistoryOfObjectRecognition - 500ppi.png:      PNG output of version 1.1
  - HistoryOfObjectRecognition ver 1.1 final.pdf: PDF output of version 1.1
  - References.xlsx:                              All References and Links
